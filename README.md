## 🏛️ Design Philosophy

The website embodies the architect's design ethos: **"Void & Form"**.
It utilizes a strict architectural grid system, varying between "Technical" (drawing/blueprint) and "Pictorial" (rendering/photo) modes, allowing users to explore projects through different lenses. But importantly, it maintains a clean, Swiss-style typographic hierarchy using `Space Grotesk` and `Inter`.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic View Toggle:** Switch instantly between 'Technical' (Line Drawings) and 'Pictorial' (Renderings) modes globally across the site.
- **Mosaic Grid Layout:** Asymmetric, responsive grid system that reflects architectural massing.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized experience across Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices.
- **Performance Focused:** prioritized vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for maximum speed and minimal bloat.
- **Custom Branding:** Minimalist SVG logo and iconography designed specifically for this portfolio.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS variables, Grid/Flexbox layouts, CSS Transitions.
- **Fonts:** Space Grotesk (Headings), Inter (Body), Space Mono (Technical Data).
- **Icons:** Custom SVG Assets.
